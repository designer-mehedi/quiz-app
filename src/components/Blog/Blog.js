It will hold the "store" and be the parent of all the components that might need that store. Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the state.

# The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component. Syntax: const refContainer = useRef(initialValue); The useRef returns a mutable ref object. This object has a property called . The useRef returns a mutable ref object.
